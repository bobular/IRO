# IRO
Insecticide Resistance Ontology - maintained by VectorBase, building on the Mosquito Insecticide Resistance Ontology developed by Louis, Topalis, Dialynas and others.

## Editing
This ontology is maintained in WebProtege
http://webprotege.stanford.edu/

At least every two months (VectorBase release cycle) we aim to pull changes from WebProtege into github.  The github version is considered to be the definitive version.

To request commenting and/or editing privileges in webprotege, please create an account on WebProtege and send an email to the VectorBase helpdesk: info@vectorbase.org stating your intentions and WebProtege username.
